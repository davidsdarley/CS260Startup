# CS 260 Notes

## Startup project:
### Ideas
      Game
      news
      peer chat
      recipes
      Scripture study app
      Weather
      Fitness tracking
      KoY stuff
      Dnd encounter tracker/spellbook or something like that
      Some kind of Stormlight RPG thing
            Skill tree tracker
            Character sheet
            level up manager

OK, so I’m not entirely sure what it is that I want to make happen here. So, we’re going to need to read through it and thing about what’s going to be hard to keep track of. 

Being able to quickly reference your abilities could be nice. I could do the skill tree manager and make it for each of the heroic paths, and then also the radiant paths. 

If I tried to make basically a DnD beyond but for stormlight, that would be a LOT of work. Like, SO MUCH WORK.

Getting the actual code to just keep track of the data wouldn’t be terribly difficult, but I don’t know most of the things that will make it doable in a pretty graphical user interface. That will probably be the hard part.

## Stormlight Startup Goals:
### Primary
 - Display basic character info
 - stats
 - skills
 - talents
 - equipment
 - equipped/dequipped
 - prioritized IN THAT ORDER
 - You can access your character sheet from anywhere. 
 - Assist in Character Creation
 - calculate numbers based on stats and tiers of experience
 - Don’t permit them to break rules in character creation.
### Secondary
 - Display skill trees
 - display full descriptions in sidebar when you click on them
