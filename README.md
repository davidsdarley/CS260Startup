# Stormlight RPG Character Tracker

[My Notes](notes.md)

I love role playing games, and I love the Stormlight archive, so naturally I got really excited when the Cosmere RPG was released, and have been looking over the rules and system since it was released. For my startup project, I wanted to make something that I would want to use, but that didn't currently exist in a form that I can easily access. So, for this project I am going to make an online character sheet, for me and my players to use. 

### Primary Goals
I have several different stages of progress I would like to make, ordered in prioritized by what is most necessary to get a basic version working. In order I will:
 - Make a web application that can help you create your character
 - Store this information on a server
 - Support login on any device to access your sheet for use and modification.
### Secondary Goals
After these things are working, I have the following secondary goals to work on now or after the class is over:
 - Share access to the character sheet with Game Masters and other players
 - Display skill trees
 - Display full descriptions in a sidebar when you click on them
 - Roll dice and calculate values for specific actions
 - Mange combat encounters

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch
Role playing games are immensely popular, and there are a multitude of useful web applications which are quite successful. Now, if there are so many of these, why would we bother with making more of the same? Well, recently a new rpg based on the best selling book series *The Stormlight Archive* was released, and initial distribution has begun. This game works on a different system than most popular games, and doesn't have many of the online resources that are seen as fairly basic to most players and game masters. My startup project aims to provide many of these resources in a format that will be appreciated by role play enjoyers, and fans of Stormlight.
